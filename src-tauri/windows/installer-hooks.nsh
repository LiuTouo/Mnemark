; Mnemark installer compatibility hooks.
;
; The product was renamed from ClipFlow to Mnemark. NSIS keys installation
; state by productName, so a stock Mnemark installer would not see the old
; ClipFlow install and would install side-by-side. These hooks migrate it:
;   PREINSTALL  — kill any running Mnemark/ClipFlow, detect the legacy
;                 ClipFlow uninstall record (HKCU then HKLM, reading
;                 UninstallString and InstallLocation from the same key), run
;                 its uninstaller passively (preserving user data), and abort
;                 with a manual-remediation message if removal fails or the
;                 old identity survives.
;   POSTINSTALL — recreate the Start Menu and Desktop shortcuts the legacy
;                 install had, as Mnemark equivalents (including /UPDATE mode,
;                 where the stock shortcut flow returns early).
; Legacy ClipFlow strings are confined to this compatibility layer by design.
